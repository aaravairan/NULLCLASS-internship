3. Time-Based Historical Image Colorization Description: Create a model that colorizes grayscale photos according to the time period they represent. The model should automatically recognize the image's era (e.g., 1900s, 1950s) and use the proper color palette for that time. Guidelines: The model should be capable of processing a wide range of historical photos and providing correct colorizations based on the observed time period. The GUI should allow users to submit photographs and see the time-based colorized results, with the option to manually alter the era if necessary.
